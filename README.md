# UFOs
## Overview of Project
- Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

- Once entering the website our client will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters that we have. There are 5 unique channels to look over; the date, city, state, country and shape. You can choose any of the channels and write in the pursuit bar, the HTML page will create the sightings for the hunt rules you entered. There can be various channels entered simultaneously to additional limited down the information to a particular pursuit standards.
